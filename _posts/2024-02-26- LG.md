<aside>
⚡ I’ve participated this project as a team member in charge of **feature extraction.** Although our team showed descent performance on public data, we had relatively low performance on our private data set.

****It was my first corporate project and by participating it, I could distinguish the importance of domain knowledge. Also, I could learn that it is important to make more generalized task by implementing more data preprocessing and analysis.
