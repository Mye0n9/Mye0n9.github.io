⚡ I’ve participated this project as a team leader and in charge of **topic modeling, _data visualization_, and analysis. Although we use simple text encoding and machine learning algorithm, it showed descent performance on turnover prediction and corporate analysis.
  
By going under the whole process of project including data collection, data preprocessing, model tuning, and analysis, it helped me to grasp the system of a project and how it works. Also, it acknowledged me that to not only addressing the result of the project, but also intertwining it with the social phenomenon is vital aspect of the project.
