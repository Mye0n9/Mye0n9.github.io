<aside>
⚡ In bootcamp, it took a look on **basic python skills** including numpy and pandas, **data crawling**, and **basics of machine learning**. Although it was hard to understand the whole lecture, it invoked my interest in artificial intelligence and became a solid basis for my later projects. 

Specifically in this project, participated as a team mate, I’ve played a roll of **data collection, environment setting, and model implementation.** Other than learning how to implement AI models in the project, it helped me to learn how to set up a Linux setting for the project and how the data should be managed in a project.
