<aside>
⚡ In this bootcamp, I got a chance to learn about Roblox environment and developed a Roblox game set in SKKU Samsung Digital Library. I’ve take a part in storyboard and creating enemy characters, including boss monster. 

It was my first experience to join a game project, and I was mainly focussed on just finishing the project. The project was not able to optimize and the gaming experience was lagged a lot. Through this project, I realized the importance of the time complexity and computational cost.
